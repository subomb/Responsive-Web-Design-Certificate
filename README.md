# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certificate

I have successfully completed the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Developer Certification.

## What I Learned:

- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: The standard markup language used to create web pages. Through building projects like a cat photo app, I solidified my understanding of HTML basics.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: The language used for designing and layout web pages. By constructing a penguin project and others, I learned modern CSS techniques, including CSS variables.

- **Accessibility**: I implemented best practices for web accessibility to ensure that web pages can be used by as many people as possible.

- **Responsive Design**: I learned to make web pages that adapt to different screen sizes using Flexbox and CSS Grid by building projects like a photo gallery and a magazine-style article layout.
